# Routing and Navigation using Vanilla JS SPA

An intuitive and responsive Single Page Application using HTML, CSS and Vanilla 
JavaScript. 

The app routing, custom component and state management was done with help from 
[zathio](https://github.com/zathio/vanilla-spa). 

The app layout was done with the help of [john-smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects). 

## App development 
The web pages were formed using JavaScript custom elements, HTML5 was used for layout and CSS was used for styling. Mobile first strategy was followed closely in developing the web pages. 

Data for the web pages were stored in JSON files and retrieved using 
XMLHttpRequest. 

localStorage was used to store data values retrieved from the JSON files. 

The modules made of JavaScript custom elements made it easy for each page to be plugged in and out of the app using the router in main.js. 

## Development server
run `npm install` to install vite web server. 

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Tests
The web page was served with vite web server. 

Tests and debugging was done using the in-built Chrome V8 engine of
Opera Web Browser.
